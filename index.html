                <p>Pumpkin seeds are edible seeds found inside pumpkins. These flat, oval seeds have a white outer husk and are green once the husk is removed. They can be eaten with or without their shells. There are plenty of ways to consume pumpkin seeds and benefit from them. Pumpkin seeds can be eaten as a snack, as a recipe ingredient, or used to make tofu, vegan butter and protein powder. You can roast them or sprinkle them onto oatmeal or overnight oats, yoghurt, or avocado toast. You can add them to salads or as a garnish for hummus, cooked vegetables, soups and stir-fries. You can incorporate pumpkin seed butter into pesto, sauces, smoothies, energy balls or baked goods.</p>
